So so sorry just come\nback. both my friends and gf ask me couple days ago. Massive thank you for the\nsupports! Enough talk about the apologize, suppose you visit my blog again right\nnow to update what I've done. Ehm, tbh there's a lot of things want to share.</p>\n<p>\nAt the middle of last month till early march. There are three professional business, automatically\nhave three issues eh three topics. But keep brevity for this post. Assume you've read\nmy previous articles. As a software engineer focused in front end dev and sometimes back end dev. So I learned\nabout how to make proper product according to requirements within timeline em sorry strict timeline.\n</p>\n<p> \nSwitching among projects after working time at office to side projects at night is my routine.\nSo maybe u have a question, <b>How you can manage the energy from early morning till night?</b> \nThe short answer is be clever to accomplish the task. Clever to manage remaining energy until memorize the reason why\nI should cope these tasks.That is from management perspective. <b>How about technically?</b>. Before write some lines of code\nor even drafting some features, I always make a connection with existing project that have been built. Oftenly open\nmy Github repo or local project to think which part that I can utilize to make my current development rapid to handle.\nAnd the most important for programming language, I recommend you using the same language. Javascript is my base programming language.\nBoth front and back end.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing again, don't forget to make good relation with the clients even in the development period.\nDon't forget to reply their questions either via WA or email. Just ensure them that the project handled with the right person.
