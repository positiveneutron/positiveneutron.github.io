D, degree.</p>\n<p>Direct Device-to-Device, communication, which refers ti direct communication\nbetween devices (i.e. users) without data traffic going through any\ninfrastructure node, has been widely foreseen to be an important foundation ti\nimprove system performance and support new services beyond 2020 in the future\nfifth generation (5G) system. In general, the benefits resulting from D2D\noperation include, among others, highly increased spectral efficiency, improved\ntypical user data rate and capacity per area, extended coverage, reduced\nlatency, and enhanced cost and power efficiency.</p>\n<p>In the future 5G system, it is predicted that network-controlled direct D2D\ncommunication offers the opportunity for local management of short-distance\ncommunication links and allows separating local traffic from the global network.\nFurther, direct D2D facilitates low-latency communication due to the local\ncommunication link between users in proximity. In fact, direct D2D has been seen\nas one of the necessary features to support real-time services in the future 5G\nsystem.</p>\n<p>Another important aspect is reliability, where an additional D2D link can be\nemployed to increase reliability through a larger extent of diversity. Moreover,\ndue to the short-distance transmission, the device power consumption can be\nreduced significantly. There are four scenarios in D2D communication.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Local data sharing, where data caching in one device can be shared with other\ndevices in proximity.</li>\n<li>Relaying, play a key role to improve network availability(i.e. to extend the\ncoverage area).</li>\n<li>Single or multi hoop, the devices within proximity can set up a peer-to-peer\nlink or multicast link that does not use the cellular network infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Discovery, Process that identifies whether a User Equipment(UE) is in\nproximity of another UE.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>LTE D2D can be seen as an add-on feature in a 4G LTE system, hence allowing\nlegacy cellular User Equipment (UE) to operate on the same carrier. In LTE, D2D\nis operated in a synchronous way, where the synchronization can be an e-Node-B(\nterm is used to refer to a base station when talking about LTE specific\naspects). Both eNode-B and UEs can act as synchronization sources. However, in\norder to facilitate inter-cell D2D operation, under certain conditions, for\nexample at the cell edge, UEs with network coverage cab transmit synchronization\nsignals as well.</p>\n<p>In LTE Release 12, D2D communication is based in physical layer broadcast\ncommunication, i.e. a physical layer broadcast solution is used to support\nbroadcast, multicast and unicast services at application layer. In order to\nsupport multicast or unicast, the targeted group ID(for multicast) or user User\nID(unicast) is indicated in the higher layer message. In the 5G system, such\nrestriction does not exist anymore, and it is predicted that D2D operation will\nbe natively integrated as part of the future 5G system. Main potential gains\nthat can be achieved include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Capacity/ throughput gain.</li>\n<li>Latency gain.</li>\n<li>Availability and realibility gain.</li>\n<li>Enabling new services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the proximity scenario, the notion of equivalent channel from a D2D transmit\n(Tx) device to a D2D receive(Rx) device through a D2D relay based on the\nharmonic mean of the composite channels from D2D Tx to D2D relay (\nG<sub>TxRe</sub>) and from D2D relay to D2D Rx(G<sub>ReRx</sub>) has been\nproposed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/G<sub>eq</sub> = 1/G<sub>TxRe</sub> + 1/<sub>ReRx</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Algorithm for this scenario called Harmonic Mode Selection (HMS) for Proximity\nCommunication</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>if</b> Geq >= max {GtxRx, GTxBs} <b>then</b></li>\n<li>Choose D2D two-hop communications</li>\n<li><b>else if</b> GTxRx >= GTxBs then</li>\n<li>Choose D2D single hop communications</li>\n<li><b>else</b></li>\n<li>Choose cellular mode, that is D2D T<sub>x</sub> and R<sub>x</sub>\ncommunication through the BS.</li>\n<li><b>endif</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, in the range scenario there are only two possible communication modes\n(direct or relay-assisted) between the D2D T<sub>x</sub> device and the BS or\nCluster Head (CH) device. Therefore, in this scenario, the definition of the\nequivalent channel must be modified such that it includes the path gain between\nthe relay device and the Base Station(BS):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/G<sub>eq</sub> = 1/G<sub>TxRe</sub> + 1/ReBs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similar with proximity scenario, HMS algorithm can be applied as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>if</b> G<sub>eq</sub> >= G<sub>TxBs</sub> <b>then</b></li>\n<li>Choose D2D relay-assisted communication</li>\n<li><b>else</b></li>\n<li>Choose cellular mode that is D2D T<sub>x</sub> transmits directly to the BS.</li>\n<li><b>endif</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To conclude this resume, it is envisioned that integrated D2D communication will\nplay a more important role in the future 5G system thanks to the promising\nbenefits on both network and end-user sides, contributing to traffic offloading,\nvery high throughput, significantly reduced latency and low power consumption.\nIn addition, D2D has the potential to increase communication availability and\nreliability, and provide additional diversity. Finally , from a service and\napplication perspective, D2D possesses the capability of enabling a number of\nnew applications such as V2V and machine-type communications.</p>\n<p><b>Reference</b></p>\n<ol>\n    <li><a href = \"https://www.amazon.com/5G-Mobile-Wireless-Communications-Technology-ebook/dp/B01EYQ8IF4\" target = \"_blank\">5G Mobile and Wireless Communications Technology.</a></li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"disqusId":6,"title":"D2D Communication Resume"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/d2d-communication-resume/"}}}
